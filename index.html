        <p> Aoshima Island is one of about a dozen "cat islands" around Japan, small places where there are 
            significantly more feline residents than people. In Aoshima more than a hundred cats prowl 
            the island, curling up in abandoned houses or strutting about in the quiet fishing village. 
            Cats outnumber humans six to one on the island. Recently becoming popular online, tiny Aoshima
             has seen a steep rise in tourist visits, overwhelming the handful of permanent residents.<br>
             But what exactly makes Aoshima so special, and different from other cat islands? There are 
             various reasons, but one of them is obvious as soon as you get off the boat, as a meowing 
             welcome committee rushes up to greet you: the local feline population density. Just a couple 
             years ago, there were some estimated 200 cats living on this tiny island. Various breeds are 
             represented, with a large majority of orange and brown tabbies, as well as calicos </p>

            You might think that there is not much to do on a small island like Aoshima… and you 
            would be right. But just imagine spending time with a bunch of friendly meowing and 
            purring cats, strolling around the island with them by your side, or just sitting down 
            to contemplate the calm waters of the Seto Inland Sea as your furry friends leisurely 
            play, stretch and sleep. Truly, Aoshima is a pure cat lover’s paradise. <br>
            Aoshima is not a tourist site, so it is very important to respect the tranquility 
            of the island, as well as private property. Some local people might enjoy interacting
             with visitors, but others just want to live in peace. Also note that Aoshima has no 
             accommodations, shops, cafes, or even vending machines, so be sure to come with all 
             you might need, and take your garbage back with you.<br>
